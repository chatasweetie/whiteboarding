# Counting Candy

Filling Jars:
You have a bunch of jars labeled 1 to N.

You are given a set of instructions detailing how much candy to put in each jar.

After you finish all the instructions, you need to return the average number of candies in each jar.

*Example Input:* [5,[1,2,100],[2,5,100],[3,4,100]]

*Explaining the Input*: 
- The first element in the array is the number of jars    
- The rest of the elements are [starting jar, ending jar, the number of candies to add to each jar]   
- [1, 2, 100] means: add 100 candies to jars 1-2   
- [2, 5, 100] means: add 100 candies to jars 2-5    
- [3, 4, 100] means: add 100 candies to jars 3-4    

*Example Output:* 160
